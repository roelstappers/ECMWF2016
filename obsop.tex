Metop metop;
IASI Iasimetop(metop);     

auto IasiP = iasimetop &  Thicknes(1000,300) & Thickness(300,100); Thickness would need state as input not possible
auto IasiP = iasimetop +  p2*Thicknes(1000,300) + p1*Thickness(300,100); Her thickness acts on GOm like  iasimetop 

auto Obsop = IasiP | Conv | ... |  

After minimization how to easily access the components?
